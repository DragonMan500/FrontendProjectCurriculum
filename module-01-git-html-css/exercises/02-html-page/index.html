<h1>My Favorite Books</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Elon, and I want to talk my favorite books as a budding reader. What makes these books so great is their author's intent in the depth of the story.
    A great example is "Fox" There is so much depth about the main character's struggle against her insecurity and how others exploit it.
    I hope we can find out what other amazing story we can find together!

<h2>Why I love reading:</h2>
<p>I love reading so much! I love it because it is the best way to engage yourself in a educational way. No matter where or how,
    you can always have a fun time learning all about a new character!
